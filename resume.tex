\sectionheader{Summary}
\summaryentry{
I help companies facing complex product development challenges achieve team-product-market within 6 to 18 months.

For this I draw on nearly two decades of experience tackling such challenges in roles ranging from software developer to tech lead, solution architect, technical founder, CTO, engineering manager and product owner.}

\sectionheader{Professional History}
\jobentry{mar 2022\\-- present}{Product Owner Data Quality Engines}{ABN Amro}{
Within ABN Amro's Data Platform I lead the teams responsible for consistently monitoring that ABN Amro’s data adheres to regulatory and internal constraints. 

The challenge consists of leading an operational team (8FTE) which hand-codes data constraints and a product team (8FTE) which develops a scalable self-service-ready solution for the operational team to migrate towards.}

\jobentry{aug 2020\\-- feb 2022}{Product Owner Data Services}{Gemeente Amsterdam}{
I joined the Amsterdam Open Data Platform at a stage where it had outgrown its 'project per dataset' technical and organisational architecture.

There I built and led a team that automatically generated REST, geospatial and BI/SQL data services for a federated data hub/self-service data mesh architecture to allow the data organisation to scale an order of magnitude.

We also prepared the infrastructure for high-security data storage according to BBN2+ standards; including a migration from an IaaS cloud to Azure.

In oktober 2021 these services were recognised in the Dutch national data strategy as a possible foundation for the future Dutch data infrastructure.}

\jobentry{may 2018\\-- mar 2019}{Interim Development Manager}{AutoTrack, de Persgroep}{
I joined AutoTrack after losing 70\% of their development team at a time when a single point of failure in their platform was on the brink of overload.

I helped them stabilise the system; rebuild the development team; double site performance and initiate a frontend redesign to improve conversion.}

\jobentry{jan 2017\\-- sep 2017}{Interim CTO}{Synple}{
I helped a logistics exchange startup scale up quickly by recruiting an inhouse Clojure development team, setting up a heterogeneous real-time processing architecture, arranging integration with external TMS providers and setting up an agile process to quickly deliver value iteratively.

Enabled them to successfully secure a \EUR{1.1}mln investment in 9 months.}

\sectionheader{Professional History}
\jobentry{oct 2014\\-- dec 2016}{Solution Architect}{Backbase}{
Led initial setup and alignment for two key workstreams of HSBC’s billion dollar technology overhaul for Commercial Banking (London/Hong Kong.)

Led solution architecture and management of the co-development roadmap for the internet banking implementation at Argenta.

Performed pre- and post sale solution architecture support for Internet Banking solutions for clients like Sberbank, Ambank, Gulfbank, KeyBank}

\jobentry{aug 2010\\-- sep 2014}{Technical Founder}{Interactly}{
Founded and built a SaaS product for conducting asynchronous (time-shifted) browser-based video interviews using Flash with best-in-class user experience for recording interactions by non-technical users world-wide.

Abandoned after finding product market fit due to an illness in the family.}

\jobentry{nov 2009\\-- nov 2012}{Solution Architect \& Lead}{TomTom}{
Played a key part in development of TomTom's new secure content provisioning platform as a developer, scrum master and tech lead.

Led development of a provisioning API for automotive partners as architect and product owner netting over \EUR{1}mln additional revenue in the process.}

\jobentry{2009}{Senior R\&D Developer}{BackBase}{
Joined in the final stage of their strategic pivot into the portal market. There I performed a last-minute rewrite of the portal core to achieve the 10x scalability improvement required for a successful launch with their first pilot client Ziggo.

Backbase is now Netherland’s 2\textsuperscript{nd} bootstrapped unicorn.}

\itemizedjobentry{2006 -- 2008}{Independent Freelance Developer}{
    \item ADCN-awarded \& Webby-nominated Blogsfam micro donation platform
